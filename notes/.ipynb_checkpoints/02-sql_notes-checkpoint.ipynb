    "\n",
    "Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be – take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year.

    "## Database normalization\n",
    "Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car). As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, and performance issues can arise when working with many large tables.\n",

    "Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database. One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **JOIN** clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the **INNER JOIN**.\n",
