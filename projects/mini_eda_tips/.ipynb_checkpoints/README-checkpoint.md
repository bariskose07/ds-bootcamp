Project: Day 1 — Mini EDA (tips)
Goal: Quick look at tip rate (tip_pct = tip / total_bill)
Data: seaborn “tips” (~244 rows, 7 columns)
What I did: basic checks (shape, info), added tip_pct and bill_per_person, made 5 plots (hist, scatter, box, bar, heatmap)
Findings: avg tip_pct ~ 16%; tip increases with bill; small differences between smoker groups;
Files: projects/mini_eda_tips/eda.ipynb, projects/mini_eda_tips/figures/
Run: open eda.ipynb in Jupyter and run all cells
